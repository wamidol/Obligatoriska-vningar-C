 * Description:  A simple implementation of a shopping assistant with a
 *               currency converter.
 * Author:       Mikolaj Wagner
 * CS username:  c18mwj
 * Date:         10/10
 * Input:        How many judges are scoring the competitor(s) minimum of 3
 *               judges and a max of 10. The scores given by the judges.
 * Output:       Prints the info of the program, number of judges and also the
 *               input values of every judge score. Then a final score is
 *               presented with the highest and lowest score then prints out an
 *               average of the points but not adding the largest or the lowest score.
 * Limitations:  No validation of input.

Program information
The program reads in the number of judges and the score from each judge.
Then it calculates the average score without regard to the lowest and highest judge score.
Finally it prints the results (the highest, the  lowest and the final average score).

Number of judges (min 3 and max 10 judges)?

Score from judge 1? -oädndligt?

Loaded scores:
Judge 1:
Jugde 2: osv

Final result:
Highest judge score:
Lowest judge score:
Final average score:
