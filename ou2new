 * Assignment 2
 * File:         ou2.c
 * Description:  A simple implementation of a program that sums up the average of
 *               up to 10 judgescores. But without regarding the highest or the
 *               lowest score. Then printing out average, highest and the lowest score.
 * Author:       Mikolaj Wagner
 * CS username:  c18mwj
 * Date:         18/10
 * Input:        How many judges are scoring the competitor(s) minimum of 3
 *               judges and a max of 10. The scores given by the judges.
 * Output:       Prints the info of the program, number of judges and also the
 *               input values of every judge score. Then a final score is
 *               presented with the highest and lowest score then prints out an
 *               average of the points but not adding the largest or the lowest score.
* Limitations: No validation of input.
